## **Minecraft: Java Edition - Shattered Moon Resourcepack**

Ever wanted to change the look of your moon in Minecraft to something... _unnatural_, but could never find the right look? This resourcepack offers the perfect blend of eerie and alien to the moon by completely shattering half of it into a crescent shape! Don't think too much about the physics behind it...

## **Tips**

Place this pack on top of other packs to overwrite the moon and leave everything else the same! The only file modified is the moon phases texture.

Since the location of that texture hasn't changed, this pack can be used on virtually any modern version of Minecraft. Enjoy!
